# misc-pages

A rather arbitrary collection of individual files to post for easy `gh-pages` viewing.

Currently consists of:

- [BLACKOUT â€“ 70 years of arguments over a uniquely Canadian infringement of Freedom of the Press](http://ameliabr.github.io/misc-pages/ABellamy-Royds-2008-ElectionBlackouts.htm), an article on the history of Canada's election law media blackout.  I wrote it in 2008 as a term paper for a Media Law class at UBC School of Journalism.  Full of fun quotes from 1938 House of Commons debates and 2008 Twitter users.
