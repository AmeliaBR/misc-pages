<h1>BLACKOUT – <i>70 years of arguments over a uniquely Canadian infringement
of Freedom of the Press</i></h1>
<i>Amelia Bellamy-Royds, 25 November 2008</i>
</header>

<h2>A tale of two elections</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>November 4, 2008: &nbsp;Election Day in the United States
of America.&nbsp; Across the country, voters wake up to the news that – with two
polls reporting – Democrat Barack Obama is leading Republican John McCain in
the presidential race by 16 votes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The results came from the small towns of Dixville Notch
and Hart’s Location, New Hampshire.&nbsp; Under New Hampshire law, a polling
district may close down, count the ballots, and report the results once all
eligible voters have voted.&nbsp; The 21 voters in Dixville Notch and 29 in
Hart’s Location gathered at midnight to be the first in the country to exercise
their democratic franchise.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This quirky tradition is a favourite of national and
international news organizations, making residents of these tiny towns media
stars for a few hours.&nbsp; The results may be insignificant in the final
nationwide tally, but they provide colour to morning newscasts on election
day.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Three weeks earlier, October 14, 2008: &nbsp;Voters in
Canada head to the polls in our own federal election.&nbsp; There are no
midnight tallies in small towns, but some votes are nonetheless finished sooner
than others.&nbsp; Staggered voting hours may reduce the effect of Canada’s six
time zones, but polls still close in Newfoundland and Labrador three hours
before they do in British Columbia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>This means that fairly reliable counts are available in
Atlantic Canada at a time when afternoon radio hosts in Vancouver are still
reminding their listeners to stop by the polling station on their way
home.&nbsp; But B.C. broadcasters can’t use the incoming results from Happy
Valley-Goose Bay or Bonavista to add some colour to their commentary.&nbsp;
Doing so would invite a $25,000 fine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Since 1938, it has been illegal to publish or broadcast
election night results from one part of Canada in another part of the country
where the polls are still open.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The pros and cons of the blackout have been debated by
parliamentary committees and Royal Commissions.&nbsp; It has been challenged
all the way to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; It causes headaches for national
newsmedia, and has never been fully enforceable.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It seems a particular affront in today’s age of instant
information. &nbsp;In the Montreal<i> Gazette</i> the morning after the
election, columnist Mike Boone whined “Is there anything more annoying than a
news blackout in the Information Age?”<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>&nbsp; But the
arguments for and against the blackout have changed remarkably little in the 70
years it has been in effect.</p>

<h2>The problem with instant news</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>It may seem like the age of bloggers and satellite
television is vastly different from the era of telegraph transmissions and
extra editions, but in 1938 politicians had already felt the sting of news that
travelled faster than the Earth could turn.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In federal elections in 1930 and 1935, newspapers in
western Canada had published special editions during the afternoon of election
day, announcing the results from the East.<a name="_ftnref2"></a><a
href="#_ftn2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>&nbsp;
Papers were handed to electors as they headed out to vote, and radio stations
likewise carried the news.&nbsp; In at least one case, the reports were grossly
inaccurate, presumably to try to influence voters to side with the alleged “winning”
party.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In 1938, Parliament was debating a new <i>Dominion
Elections Act</i>, and members of all parties agreed that something should be
done to limit the impact of these early news reports.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a></span>&nbsp;
Tommy Douglas, then an MP for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, summed
up the extent of the problem:</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>Right across the street from where people were voting in
my constituency [during the last election] was a huge sign on which were the
words, “Liberal landslide in the east.”&nbsp; It might just as well be a
Conservative of a C.C.F. in the next election.&nbsp; It is bound to have a
psychological effect on the voter who is going to cast his ballot.</p>

<p class=BodyTextContinue>The Conservative MP from Vancouver South complained
that it “was exasperating that our electors were not being given an opportunity
to cast their ballots without knowing the results in the east.”&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Three choices</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The committee that studied the bill had proposed one
solution:&nbsp; stagger the voting hours, so that polls in the Maritimes closed
an hour later (at 7 p.m.) than most of the country, while polls in the West
closed an hour earlier (at 5 p.m.).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Politicians from both sides of the country denounced the
plan.&nbsp; Those in Nova Scotia were worried about citizens voting in the
dark.&nbsp; Those from British Columbia were worried about voters unable to get
home from work in time to vote.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Some MPs suggested that the voting hours should be left
alone, but the ballots not counted until polls had closed nationwide.&nbsp;
Charles Power, the Liberal Minister of Pensions, knocked down that proposal
with the suggestion that the “idle hands” of election staff “will find evil to
do.”&nbsp; Others argued that it would keep elections officials working too
late and the public waiting around impatiently.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The third option, suggested by a number of members, was to
simply ban the transmission or publication of results.&nbsp; The main
objections raised to this proposal were that it would be ineffective, since
radio broadcasts could be made through the United States, and that it contradicted
freedom of the press.&nbsp; Minister Power argued that “a greater amount of
abuse than that now existing would be necessary to warrant the parliament of
Canada preventing newspapers from publishing accurate news.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nonetheless, with no support for the first two proposals,
the blackout was adopted, making it illegal to publish election results in any
area where the polls had not closed.</p>

<h2>Reforming Electoral Democracy: the Lortie Commission</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Fifty years later, much had changed in the way Canadians
communicated with one another, but much had stayed the same in Canadian
electoral laws.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In an April 1989 speech from the Throne, the newly
re-elected Mulroney government promised a Royal Commission on electoral
reform.&nbsp; Businessman Pierre Lortie, previously the chair of Quebec grocery
chain Provigo and later the head of Bombardier, was selected as chair when the
commission was established in November of that year.<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a
href="#_ftn4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a>&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The commission held hearings across the country in 1990
and 1991.&nbsp; Proposed changes ranged from the grand to the
administrative.&nbsp; Ban political donations from corporations and
unions.&nbsp; Limit advertising on election issues by anyone other than
candidates and parties.&nbsp; Create a permanent voters’ list to replace the
enumeration process.&nbsp; Set aside seats for aboriginal Canadians.&nbsp;
Allow judges and prisoners to vote.&nbsp; Abolish a law prohibiting the sale of
alcohol on during voting hours.&nbsp; Forbid the publication of opinion polls
during a campaign.&nbsp; Legally mandate televised debates by party
leaders.&nbsp; And, of course, do something about the problem of elections
being decided before Western Canadians had voted.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>At a commission hearing in the Yukon, the territory’s
Senator, Paul Lucier, argued “Western and northern Canadians going to the polls
when the election results have already been broadcast is an insult that can no
longer be tolerated.”<a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a>&nbsp; Lucier suggested that polls in
Western time zones could open the evening before election day in order to maintain
ease of access.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Even before the Commission began hearings, commission
chair Lortie indicated that the members were considering a proposal to stagger
the voting hours across the country so that polls would open and close
simultaneously, regardless of time zone.<a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>&nbsp; Under this
system, polls would be open from noon to 10 p.m. in Newfoundland and from 8:30
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in B.C. and the Yukon.&nbsp; There would be no need for a
broadcasting blackout.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The arguments against the staggered voting hours were the
same as they had been in 1938:&nbsp; it would keep election workers up too late
in the East and interfere with the business day in the West.&nbsp; Lortie
suggested that the second half of that problem could be solved by holding
elections on Sundays.<a name="_ftnref7"></a><a href="#_ftn7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party
Financing released its final report on February 13, 1992.<a name="_ftnref8"></a><a
href="#_ftn8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[8]</span></a>&nbsp; On
the subject of controlling the impact of eastern Canadian election results on
western Canadian voters, commission members examined the same three options
that had been discussed in Parliament in 1938.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On the blackout law, the report argued it “had been
rendered obsolete” by new technologies, and pointed out (just as it had been in
1938) that Western Canadians could learn election results from broadcasters in
U.S. border cities.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On the option of delaying the counting of votes, it
concluded that “if staff had to stay for this additional time, it would appear
logical to keep the polls open.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Instead, the commissioners chose the option that had been
dismissed five decades earlier, staggering the voting hours.&nbsp; The report
recommended that polls in Ontario and East be open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.,
local time, and that voting hours in Central and Mountain time zones be set to
so to be simultaneous with those in Ontario and Quebec.&nbsp; Hours in the
Pacific time zone would be a half-hour delayed, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local
time.&nbsp; Lortie’s previous suggestion of Sunday elections was not endorsed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Although the proposed system would have polls closing in
Atlantic Canada up to two hours before close in the West, the Commission
recommended the abolition of the blackout law.&nbsp; The report concluded that
the release of results from this very limited number of seats “would not
constitute a major problem so long as other results from eastern Canada were
not available.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A <i>Vancouver Sun</i> editorial the next day called the
proposal “the queerest (version) yet” of staggered voting hours, saying “it
would confuse everybody without solving the problem.”<a name="_ftnref9"></a><a
href="#_ftn9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[9]</span></a></p>

<h2>New law, old arguments</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As with many Royal Commissions, the recommendations were
not immediately adopted by the government.&nbsp; The 1993 election was
campaigned under the old rules, and the new Liberal government was not in a
rush to implement the proposals.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Changes to voting hours were one of the first amendments
enacted.&nbsp; The necessary amendments were added during committee study of a
bill establishing the permanent voters’ list.&nbsp; The changes were inspired
in part by a private member’s bill introduced earlier in the session by
Vancouver East MP Anna Terrana.&nbsp; Terrana’s bill advocated simultaneous
voting, but the amendments adopted by the committee were closer to the Lortie
Commission’s proposal.&nbsp; The only difference was that polls in Atlantic
Canada would close at 8:30 p.m. local time, not 9:30, making the maximum
difference in poll closures from East to West three hours instead of two.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Even with this minor difference, the only results
available before polls closed in the West would be those from Atlantic Canada.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The debate on the changes brought up the same three
options: staggered voting hours, delayed vote counts, or the blackout.&nbsp;
Stephen Harper proposed an amendment which would include all three elements,
just to be sure.<a name="_ftnref10"></a><a href="#_ftn10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[10]</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the end, the staggered voting hours were adopted, but
the prohibition on reporting early results was left untouched. &nbsp;A major
overhaul of the <i>Canada Elections Act</i> in 2000 also preserved the
then-62-year-old restriction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In September 2000 the blackout law earned some notoriety
when it was applied to two by-elections held on opposite sides of the
country.&nbsp; Because of the law, results from Kings-Hants, Nova Scotia could
not be broadcast nationally or published online until polls closed in
Okanagan–Coquihalla, B.C., four hours later.&nbsp; A Nova Scotia man who
contravened the blackout by posting results on his website later had his house
raided and his computer seized by Elections Canada officials.<a name="_ftnref11"></a><a
href="#_ftn11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[11]</span></a></p>

<h2>ElectionResultsCanada.com</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Paul Bryan of Burnaby, B.C., thought this was
unreasonable.&nbsp; In preparation for the November 27, 2000 federal election,
he set up a web site, ElectionResultsCanada.com, to publish Atlantic Canada
election results during the blackout.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In a press release issued one month before the election,
Bryan indicated that he was intentionally challenging a “gag law” he believed
was contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&nbsp; “Election
gag laws have no place in a free and democratic society,” the release quoted
him as saying.&nbsp; “Ordinary citizens must step up and challenge such laws or
else face losing their rights altogether.”<a name="_ftnref12"></a><a
href="#_ftn12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[12]</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The press release garnered Bryan attention from news media
across the country.&nbsp; It also earned him the attention of Elections
Canada.&nbsp; A week before the election, he received an email from legal
counsel to the Commissioner of Canada Elections.&nbsp; It referenced the media
coverage, informed him of the legal prohibition and penalties, and
concluded:&nbsp; “We trust that, as you are now aware of the prohibition, you
will comply with the <em>Canada Elections Act</em> by refraining to publish the
results until all polls across Canada have closed on election day.” <a
name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[13]</span></a>&nbsp; Undaunted, Bryan posted the
letter on his website.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On election night, ElectionResultsCanada.com carried early
results from Atlantic Canada, taken from satellite television.&nbsp; Within
weeks of the election, Bryan was subject to a search warrant and then charged
with violating the <em>Canada Elections Act</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Reasonable limits</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The case reached court in early 2003.&nbsp; Bryan applied
to the trial judge, Judge K. A. P. D. Smith of the B.C. Provincial Court, to
have the pertinent sections of the <i>Canada Elections Act</i> struck down as
an unconstitutional infringement of his right to freedom of expression.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Canadian judges use a two-step process to determine
whether a law contravenes the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.&nbsp;
First, the applicant must demonstrate that the law infringes a right guaranteed
by the Charter.&nbsp; If the court agrees that it does, the government
prosecution has to defend the law on the basis of section 1 of the Charter:</p>

<p class=MsoBlockText>The <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>
guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such
reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free
and democratic society.</p>

<p class=BodyTextContinue>In assessing whether the limits are reasonable, the
court considers not only the purpose of the limit, but also whether the benefit
is greater than the harm.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the case against Paul Bryan, the trial judge and all
subsequent appeal judges agreed that the election night blackout infringes
Canadians’ guaranteed “freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression,
including freedom of the press and other media of communication.”<a
name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftn14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[14]</span></a>&nbsp; The debate was whether the infringement
could be “demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Judge Smith ruled that the limit was reasonable and the
law constitutional.&nbsp; With his constitutional challenge dismissed, Bryan
did not dispute the evidence of the case.&nbsp; He was convicted of the charge
and fined $1000.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Bryan and his lawyers appealed; their arguments were heard
by Justice S. Kelleher of the B.C. Supreme Court in September 2003.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In re-examining the case, Justice Kelleher focused on the
Lortie commission’s recommendation to drop the blackout law.&nbsp; He concluded
that there was no “pressing and substantial” need for a blackout, since results
from Atlantic Canada alone could not decide an election.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Justice Kelleher released his decision on October 23, 2003,
overturning the conviction and striking down the election night blackout.</p>

<h2>A short-lived victory</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The government appealed Justice Kelleher’s decision to the
B.C. Court of Appeal.&nbsp; Leave to appeal was granted in March 2004, but a
hearing was not held until the next May.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the meantime, a federal election was called for June
28, 2004.&nbsp; Justice Kelleher’s decision meant that the blackout law could
not be enforced in British Columbia, but his decision was not binding on the
rest of the country.&nbsp; Elections Canada, however, announced that, to
“achieve uniform application of the Act across the country,” they would not
enforce the blackout, anywhere.<a name="_ftnref15"></a><a href="#_ftn15"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[15]</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the 2004 election, therefore, national newsmedia and
personal websites were free to publish all election results as they were
announced, coast to coast.&nbsp; Elections Canada’s own website, however, did
not post results until polls had closed nationwide.<a name="_ftnref16"></a><a
href="#_ftn16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[16]</span></a>&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The blackout had been lifted, but only temporarily.&nbsp;
On 20 May 2005, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in a 2 to 1 judgement,
re-affirmed the constitutionality of the blackout law and restored Paul Bryan’s
conviction.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Bryan appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which heard
arguments on October 16, 2006.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Up until this point, the only evidence that had been
considered was the Lortie commission report and the testimony of Robert
MacDermid, a political science professor from York University.&nbsp; MacDermid
had testified, based on studies of United States presidential elections, that
voter turnout in Western time zones dropped when media reports announced a
winner before the polls had closed.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the Supreme Court, the government introduced the
results of a poll<a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftn17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[17]</span></a> on the blackout law, conducted
during the 2005/2006 election campaign.&nbsp; The poll concluded that 70% of
Canadians “thought people should not be able to know election results from
other provinces before their polls close.”&nbsp; On the opposite side of the
debate, the Court heard arguments from a coalition of national broadcasters,
who testified about the technical difficulties of implementing the blackout.</p>

<h2>Protecting “informational equality”</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On March 15, 2007, a majority of the Supreme Court of
Canada ruled that election results blackout was constitutional.<a
name="_ftnref18"></a><a href="#_ftn18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[18]</span></a>&nbsp; In the words of Justice Michel
Bastarache, “the salutary effects of s. 329 outweigh the deleterious
effects.”&nbsp; In layman’s terms, the pros outweigh the cons.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>According to Bastarache and the other justices who upheld
the blackout, the key value protected by the law is “informational equality.”
&nbsp;Because Newfoundlanders cannot know how other parts of the country have
voted before they cast their ballots, neither should British Columbians.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The justices did not put considerable weight on the
possibility that election outcomes could be changed by publishing early
results, but they did consider the importance of maintaining the “subjective
perceptions of Canadian voters that the electoral system is fair” in light of
the polling results.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The court’s decision was far from unanimous:&nbsp; four
out of nine justices disagreed with the ruling.&nbsp; The dissenting justices
argued that within the context of staggered voting hours, the blackout had
little effect on the outcome or perceived fairness of the election.&nbsp; While
the five justices who upheld the blackout were of the opinion that a three-hour
blackout was only a minor delay, the dissenters argued that “News is news precisely
because of its immediacy” and that Canadians have a right to learn the outcome
of an election as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Current and Future Complications</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The decision of the Supreme Court did not address all
possible legal questions arising from the blackout law.&nbsp; One which remains
is where to draw the line between private and public communications.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The current wording of the blackout provision prohibits
the “transmission” of results (or purported results) to “the public” in a
blacked-out electoral district.<a name="_ftnref19"></a><a href="#_ftn19"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[19]</span></a>&nbsp; Posting
material on a public website, as Paul Bryan did, has been clearly accepted as
transmission of information to the public.&nbsp; But what if the information is
posted to a website with very limited access, such as a facebook page?&nbsp;
How would sending the results to one’s online “friends” differ from picking up
a phone and calling family on the other side of the country?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>On a more practical level, there is the question of
whether the law can ever be enforced given the diversity of ways in which
Canadians can now communicate with one another.&nbsp; On Twitter networks on
election night – whereby individuals can broadcast news and gossip by text
message (“Tweets”) to anyone who is listening for certain key words – results
flowed freely while the blackout was still in effect.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Some participants were cautious, asking for example,
“s**t, are we even allowed to tweet results if polls still open in BC?”<a
name="_ftnref20"></a><a href="#_ftn20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[20]</span></a>&nbsp; Others encouraged defiance of
the law:&nbsp; “<span class=msgtxten>Come on twitter, let's make history and
break the news blackout,</span>” urged one user.<a name="_ftnref21"></a><a
href="#_ftn21" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[21]</span></a>&nbsp;
Six weeks after the election, there have been no reports of “Tweeters” have had
their computers seized by Elections Canada officials wielding search
warrants.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Will the blackout ever be lifted?</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Supreme Court may have ruled that the election night
blackout law is constitutional, but the law can still be changed by
Parliament.&nbsp; If public sentiment is strong, politicians tend to follow suit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Nonetheless, Canada’s geography hasn’t changed, so the
same options – and arguments – remain.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>If the blackout is dropped but current voting hours
maintained, Atlantic Canadian results will be available for late voters in the
West, and could potentially impact election outcomes.&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>If voting hours were changed to be completely
simultaneous, voters and election staff at both ends of the country would be
inconvenienced by too late or too early voting times. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>And if vote counts were delayed, everyone would complain:&nbsp;
election workers would have to stay up late out east, and news junkies would
have to wait just as long or longer for their results.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>But then again, if the residents of Dixville Notch can all
show up to vote at midnight, what are Canadians complaining about?</p>
